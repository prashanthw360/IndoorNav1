# NaaS: Navigation as a Service
## Objectives:
1. To develop a mobile application which provides indoor navigation facility for
customers through Bluetooth beacons inside vast buildings like malls, airports, etc. <br>
2. To easily evacuate people from buildings during catastrophes.<br>
3. To aid the customers in making better decisions at while buying products at their
fingertips.<br>
4. To utilize the beacon technology for helping businesses to grow and to understand
their customers better.<br>

## Development
1. Used the android beacon library (open source) to interact with the beacons and Volley
and OkHttp libraries for making REST API calls.<br>
2. Implemented multi-threading with the help of Asynctask and handler class.<br>
3. The system with beacons is highly accurate for indoor navigation when compared with
GPS. Beacon-based proximity marketing is one of the most effective marketing. Footfall
analysis is also done through beacons. A web portal is provided for each business
owner to feed store data and customers interface with the system through the mobile
application.<br>
4. Due to the low cost and multiple use cases of the beacons, it can be deployed in huge
commercial centres where hassle-free navigation is to be provided along with other
business use cases.<br>
