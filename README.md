# NaaS: Navigation as a Service
## Objectives:
▪ To develop a mobile application which provides indoor navigation facility for
customers through Bluetooth beacons inside vast buildings like malls, airports, etc.
▪ To easily evacuate people from buildings during catastrophes.
▪ To aid the customers in making better decisions at while buying products at their
fingertips.
▪ To utilize the beacon technology for helping businesses to grow and to understand
their customers better.

## Development
◦ Used the android beacon library (open source) to interact with the beacons and Volley
and OkHttp libraries for making REST API calls.
◦ Implemented multi-threading with the help of Asynctask and handler class.
◦ The system with beacons is highly accurate for indoor navigation when compared with
GPS. Beacon-based proximity marketing is one of the most effective marketing. Footfall
analysis is also done through beacons. A web portal is provided for each business
owner to feed store data and customers interface with the system through the mobile
application.
◦ Due to the low cost and multiple use cases of the beacons, it can be deployed in huge
commercial centres where hassle-free navigation is to be provided along with other
business use cases.
